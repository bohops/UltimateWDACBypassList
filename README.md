# Ultimate WDAC Bypass List

A centralized resource for previously documented WDAC/Device Guard/UMCI bypass techniques as well for building/managing/testing WDAC policies

*Many of the LOLBINs are included on the [Applications that can bypass WDAC List](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/windows-defender-application-control/design/applications-that-can-bypass-wdac) formerly called the "Microsoft Recommended Block Rules List"
 - `Pro Tip`: If applying the Block Rules policy, don't forget to remove the first two file rules: `ID_ALLOW_A_1` and `ID_ALLOW_A_2`

*This repository was inspired by [Oddvar Moe](https://twitter.com/Oddvarmoe)'s [Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List](https://github.com/api0cradle/UltimateAppLockerByPassList)

*As always, this is a work in progress...
